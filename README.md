## FastAPI Microservices for Multi-Seller Platform

## Overview

This project is a FastAPI-based microservice system designed to allow Instagram sellers to create their own online digital store, manage products, and accept payments. The system enables sellers to move away from handling sales via DMs and instead sell through a dedicated website with an admin panel. The architecture is built using microservices with a combination of IAM (Identity and Access Management) and a Core service and a Media service.
